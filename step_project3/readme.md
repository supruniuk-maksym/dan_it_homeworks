The Goal of Step_project3:

1. Set Up AWS Infrastructure with Terraform:
**●     Create S3 Bucket:
**○     Create an S3 bucket to store Terraform state files.
●     Define VPC and Networking:
○     Use Terraform to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets. 1 public (Jenkins master) and 1 private (Jenkins worker)
○     Set up Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway.
●     Launch EC2 Instances:
○     Add your ssh-key for access to EC2 in public subnet.
○     Create a security group to allow SSH and HTTP access.
○     Launch on-demand EC2 instance for Jenkins master and spot instance for Jenkins worker within the created subnets. Add your public SSH key using terraform user-data.
○     Use variables and output values to manage configurations.
2. Set Up Jenkins master with Ansible:
●     Write an Ansible playbook to install Jenkins on the deployed EC2 instance.
●     Install nginx and configure it as a reverse proxy for Jenkins web server using Ansible
3. Set Up Jenkins
●     Add a Jenkins worker to the Jenkins master.
●     Deploy the same pipeline from Step project 2 and check if it's working as expected.
4. Destroy all resources in the end.
Note: all deployment code (Terrafrom, Ansible, Jenkinsfile etc) should be stored in the GitHub repository.
